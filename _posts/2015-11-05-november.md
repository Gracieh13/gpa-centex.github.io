**Painting with a Twist**

<br>8820 Burnet Rd. Austin at the intersection of 183

If you missed the fun painting class we had a couple months ago, here is your chance!  This is
a custom canvas of your pet (any pet, does not need to be a greyhound.)  **You must register in
advance and supply a JPEG photo head shot of your pet by 11/10**.  This class is limited to 30
participants and always sells out, so
[REGISTER](http://paintingwithatwist.com/events/viewevent.aspx?eventID=557192) soon.
Cost is $55. Your canvas will be pre-sketched and ready for you to paint.
All supplies are included. You will go home with a completed 16 x 20 painting you can be proud of.

In addition, we will have a special early shopping event with
[Accent Gem Designs and Treasures](http://accentgemdesigns.com/)
While you’re painting, Michele will have a table set up with her incredible
gemstone jewelry for your holiday shopping ease.  Accent Gem Designs is all about providing
beautiful and unique jewelry that will enhance your fashion and style while inspiring body,
mind and spirit.  Take a sneak peek at her online store, but come shop on 11/15.  Michele
will be donating a percentage of her sales that evening to GPA Central Texas.
