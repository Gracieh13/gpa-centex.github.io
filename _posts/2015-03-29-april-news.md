Join us in celebrating _**20 years**_ of greyhound adoptions!

_**TO BE RESCHEDULED DUE TO WEATHER**_

This will be a family and hound friendly day on a beautiful, fully-fenced acre in Northwest
Austin.

We will begin the day promptly at 11 am, with our guest speaker, Katie Meier DVM from
[Austin Heart Vet](http://austinheartvet.com/).  Dr. Meier will offer us an informative
presentation about heart disease in greyhounds with a Q&A session following.
Afterward, we will be grilling up burgers and brats (vegan options, too.)  Please bring a
side dish or dessert to share. **Cirrus Logic** will be donating our food costs, so no funds are
taken away from the hounds for this event.

The afternoon will be for greyhound games, romping, running and socializing.  Please bring a
muzzle.

We will have a brief membership meeting to keep everyone up to date on our latest
accomplishments and future plans.  We can answer any questions you may have about the
upcoming Board of Directors election and what role you can play in this organization.

**We hope to see you there!**
