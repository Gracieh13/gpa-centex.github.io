[![Pound For Pound](/img/poundforpound.jpg)](http://www.tomlinsons.com/)

Every holiday season, Tomlinson’s hosts Austin’s largest pet food drive in support of local
animal rescues. From Nov. 27 through Dec. 24, each bag that customers donate will be matched by
their generous pet food vendors, doubling the total amount donated.  Each pound donated will go
to feed rescue animals throughout Central Texas, and we are blessed to have been chosen as one
of the recipients.

Thanks to Tomlinson’s and their generous customers, our foster dogs will be eating well in
2016!
