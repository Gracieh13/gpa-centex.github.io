Dear Friends, Members and Supporters of GPA Central Texas,

![race](/img/race.jpg)

With the recent media coverage regarding the Texas Racing Commission funding and the
announcement by Gulf Greyhound Park that they will cease live racing at the end of 2015, we
thought it a good idea to share with you information as we  know today and how these two
situations may affect GPA Central Texas.

We have contacted Texas Greyhound Association and the Director of Gulf Greyhound Park to
assure them GPA Central Texas will do what we can to help with the greyhounds when the time
comes.  There will be many dozens  of hounds needing to be placed with adoption groups in the
next few months, but for now, it is business as usual. We have already heard from a few folks
who have offered to foster a hound for this special set of circumstances. As always, our
ability to bring in more greyhounds is directly affected by the number of people willing to
foster. If you have ever considered fostering or adopting a greyhound, this would be a good
time to step forward, so that we can be prepared for changes that may affect us soon. If you
have questions or would like additional information about fostering please contact
[president@gpa-centex.org](mailto:president@gpa-centex.org) or
[foster@gpa-centex.org](mailto:foster@gpa-centex.org).

Updates will be provided as details become available.

The GPA CenTex Board of Directors and I sincerely appreciate your continuing support.

Tommi Howell, President
