## It’s Time For Another Greyhound PLAYDAY!

We will be hosting a greyhound playday on Saturday, June 6 at the
[Doghouse Drinkery](http://www.doghousedrinkery.com/) in Leander.
Join us from 10:30 until noon.  There will be a brief membership meeting and then lots of fun
and friendship.  Please bring a muzzle for your hound.

## Fostering Saves Lives

We are in desperate need of foster families, or as we like to call them, our “Greyhound
Guardian Angels.”   Due to a couple of emergencies this month, and now the summer travel
season, we have an urgent need for more foster homes.  All medical costs are paid by GPA
including monthly heartworm and flea prevention.  Equipment, food and support are available,
also.  Our foster families are our most valuable volunteers, and we absolutely could not
fulfill our mission without them.  We will help you polish up that halo and earn some good
karma points in no time.

See our [foster](/foster/) page for more info.
