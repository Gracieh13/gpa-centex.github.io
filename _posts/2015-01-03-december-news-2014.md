## Membership Renewal

Itâ€™s time to renew your Greyhound Pets of America - Central Texas membership! Annual membership
dues are $30 and are due on January 1st. If you adopt a dog from GPA-CT your dues are waived
for the calendar year. If you foster a dog for GPA-CT your dues are waived during the calendar
year(s) that you foster.

See the [Join](http://gpa-centex.org/join/) page for a link to the Membership Application
and a link to a secure PayPal account to make
your dues payment. We are an all-volunteer group and your dues are used toward re-homing
greyhounds.

Thank you for supporting GPA-CT!

That very special boy [Zander](http://gpa-centex.org/greyhounds/zoolander/), found a very
special family - the Borgeson's.  We look forward to
lots of posts about this pup as he grows.  Thank you to the Wylie's and the Whaley's who helped
him along his way.
