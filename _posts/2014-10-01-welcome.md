I’d like to personally welcome each of you to the new and improved GPA Central Texas website!
Isn’t it GREYT!  Thank you to everyone who volunteered their time, resources and provided
valuable input for this project.  A special Thank You to Zach Whaley and Mark Darholt who
provided their IT expertise.  This project could not have been completed without everyone
working as a team.

Please visit the website often for news and updates about the magnificent greyhounds in our
care.  We could not accomplish what we do without your support.  I sincerely thank you.

Tommi Howell, President, GPA Central Texas
