The **Pound for Pound Food Drive** is a cherished tradition at locally owned **Tomlinson’s Pet
Supplies**.  This year GPA Central Texas has been chosen as one of the local animal rescue groups
that will benefit.

Here’s how you can help:

* Drop by any Tomlinson’s location,
* Upon checkout, donate a 5, 15 or 30 lb. bag of pet food,
* Check “GPA Central Texas” on the ballot as the organization you choose to receive your donation,
* Spread the word to family, friends, neighbors.

Tomlinson’s will match “pound for pound” all donations, thus doubling the total amount!  All
food donations will go to our greyhounds in foster care.  The food drive runs from November 28,
through December 24, 2014.
