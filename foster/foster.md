**MORE** retiring and rescued greyhounds are on their way to us and are in need of a soft place
to land. If you have considered fostering, NOW is the time to make a difference in a greyhound's
life. Please send your foster application (download below) to:
[foster@gpa-centex.org](mailto:foster@gpa-centex.org).

GPA-Central Texas ALWAYS needs caring foster homes (with or without cats!). GPA-CT provides the
basic supplies; you provide lessons on home life, bed, safety, warmth, affection, and
training for becoming someone's forever companion. Recently, Tomlinson's has generously donated food for our foster families, so now there is absolutely no monetary cost to fostering.

Greyhounds are very intelligent and learn
very quickly, particularly when given daily affection.  During the time they are in foster
care, the greyhounds are taken to the veterinarian, get their annual shots, are spayed or
neutered, have their teeth cleaned, are tested for heartworms and put on heartworm
preventative. During their visit, they are also evaluated for any injuries or health problems.
Once this is done, GPA-CT begins the process of finding a home for the greyhound, and the
foster family plays a big role in ensuring the right placement of the greyhound.

Foster families are our most important volunteers. Without them, GPA-CT cannot fulfill its
mission. The main limitation on the number of dogs GPA-CT can bring into its adoption program
is the number of volunteer foster families. If you would like to volunteer to foster a newly
retired racing greyhound, please review the Foster FAQs below.
