        <h1>Adoption FAQs</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="panel-body page-content">
        <h2 id="what-are-the-adoption-costs-involved">What are the adoption costs involved?</h2>
<p><strong>A non-refundable deposit of $50</strong> should be submitted along with your application.
This may be paid by check or electronically through our website at <a href="http://gpa-centex.org/donate/">gpa-centex.org/donate/</a>.
The remaining  donation is due when an adoption is finalized.</p>

<p>Effective April 1, 2016, adoption fees are as follows (these amounts are in addition to the deposit):</p>

<ul>
  <li>for puppies less than one year old, the donation will be $300</li>
  <li>for adult dogs age 1 - 8 years, the donation will be $200</li>
  <li>for senior dogs greater than 8 years, the donation will be $100.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your adoption will include a collar and leash set, muzzle, reference book, GPA-CT tag, one year
membership in GPA Central Texas and the support of your GPA adoption team.  Your greyhound will
have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, micro-chipped, tested for heartworm and other parasites,
and (except puppies) received a full dental.</p>

<p>There is no deposit or fee required with foster applications.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-prerequisites-for-adoption">What are the prerequisites for adoption?</h2>
<p>Greyhounds are not for everyone. Greyhounds should not be kept as outside dogs or left in a garage. They have insufficient body fat and too
sparse a coat and do not adapt well to extreme heat or cold. GPA-CT also reserves the right to deny any application for
any reason.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-temperament-of-these-dogs">What is the temperament of these dogs?</h2>
<p>Greyhounds are generally gentle, quiet, clean, and good-natured.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-their-life-expectancy">What is their life expectancy?</h2>
<p>Although most large breed dogs do not live as long as small breeds, track greyhounds have such an excellent athletic
start in life that you can expect them to live until they are 12 to 14 years old.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-exercise-do-they-need">How much exercise do they need?</h2>
<p>Greyhounds need no more exercise than other large dogs, but they enjoy running in enclosed areas and taking walks. They
must NEVER be turned off-leash! Most of the time they are content to sleep.</p>

<h2 id="are-greyhounds-easy-to-train-and-handle">Are greyhounds easy to train and handle?</h2>
<p>Greyhounds are extremely sensitive and intelligent animals, responding quickly to talk and touch as rewards. A stern
voice quickly checks a greyhound. No physical punishment should ever be used!</p>

<h2 id="are-ex-racing-greyhounds-housebroken">Are ex-racing greyhounds housebroken?</h2>
<p>Greyhounds are “kennel trained” – they are trained to keep their kennels clean. At first, walk your dog frequently, and
he will quickly learn his new home is the place he keeps clean and outside is the place he can relieve himself. When you
are away from home, it helps to limit the area in which he can roam within the house. This helps him identify the areas
to keep clean and limits his ability to get into trouble.</p>

<h2 id="are-greyhounds-good-with-children">Are greyhounds good with children?</h2>
<p>In general, because track dogs are handled by breeders, haulers, trainers, and track workers throughout their careers,
they are highly socialized. Typically they are tolerant of children, but each dog is different and all should be
respected. Often, greyhounds will view children that are close to their height as littermates and may try to play with a
child like they would another hound. This also means that they may correct a child the same way they would a littermate.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-they-with-other-pets">How are they with other pets?</h2>
<p>Greyhounds are friendly by nature and most socialize well with other dogs as a result of interaction with other
greyhounds in the racing kennels. Some learn to accept cats and other small pets, but any introductory period should be
closely monitored.</p>

<h2 id="do-they-make-good-jogging-companions">Do they make good jogging companions?</h2>
<p>Yes! However, their track experience prepares them for sprinting on dirt tracks only. Long exposure to asphalt or
concrete may hurt the pads of their feet unless they are allowed to acclimate gradually. You will also have to build
them up slowly to your pace and distance.</p>

<h2 id="do-they-make-good-watch-dogs">Do they make good watch dogs?</h2>
<p>No. They are far too gentle, but the psychological impact of a large dog can be a deterrent to would-be troublemakers.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-greyhounds-wear-muzzles-on-the-track">Why do greyhounds wear muzzles on the track?</h2>
<p>Greyhounds wear racing muzzles because as they round the bend on an oval track, some of them may bump shoulders due to
the centrifugal force of the turn. This could potentially lead to a dogfight. Track officials prevent this possibility
by muzzling. Racing muzzles are used for photo finishes as well.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-special-responsibilities-if-i-adopt-a-greyhound">Are there special responsibilities if I adopt a greyhound?</h2>
<p>Your greyhound must be kept on year-round heartworm preventative, kept free of parasites, receive regular vaccinations,
be kept indoors, and wear a GPA-CT identification tag at all times.</p>
