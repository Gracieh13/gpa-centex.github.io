I'm a gentle gentleman named Waco. I was found as a stray in the Waco, Texas area a couple of months ago, and adapted quickly to home life in my foster home. I'm living with small dogs and cats, and we are one big happy family. I'm currently going through heartworm treatment, and look forward to finishing that up in a couple of months. After I'm heartworm free, I will be on the market to find my forever family!
