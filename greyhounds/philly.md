I am a very athletic and beautiful greyhound, at least that's what people tell me. :) I had a long racing career, racking up over 150 races and several puppy litters. In my retirement, I still enjoy running sprints in the backyard. I am the fastest among my 3 foster greyhound siblings! I also love to be around people, and have a happy and playful disposition. I receive many compliments on my beautiful white coat. I'm looking for my foster family, and hope to meet them soon!

**Update**:

Sadly, Philly has been diagnosed with Cancer in her shoulder.  Surgery is not an option.  She will remain a permanent foster resident in her current home where she is attached and happy.  Philly is not in any pain and still quite active.  As long as she is enjoying life, we will continue to support her.

GPA has never shied away from the older, sick or stray hounds.  If you would like to donate to Phillyâ€™s ongoing care, you may do so using the _Sponsor Me_ button below.
