I am a very athletic and beautiful greyhound, at least that's what people tell me. :) I had a long racing career, racking up over 150 races and several puppy litters. In my retirement, I still enjoy running sprints in the backyard. I am the fastest among my 3 foster greyhound siblings! I also love to be around people, and have a happy and playful disposition. I receive many compliments on my beautiful white coat. I'm looking for my foster family, and hope to meet them soon!
