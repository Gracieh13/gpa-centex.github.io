Eight years young, Silver Sloan's foster says Silvie has been doing well….sleeps thru the night, without accidents.
She lets me know when she wants out by standing at the door and whining. She loves being outside, and has to be coaxed
back in when it’s bitter cold out. When the guest Bridge Ladies came over to visit her foster mom, she thoroughly
enjoyed their attention. We’ve been to the dog park, and she’s met lots of dogs….she gets along well with all of
them. She springs about like a puppy when other dogs invite her to play. None of them have been able to keep up with
her. It’s a joy to see an 'old girl' so spry. When Santa's elves weren't looking, Silvie developed a funny habit of
getting under the Christmas tree and spinning it around, spraying the room with ornaments. While very entertaining,
we corrected her behavior, and by the second day she caught on. She’s very smart, and willing to follow directions.
Silvie is currently being treated for kidney stones, a condition manageable by diet. With her special diet and TLC,
she has gained enough weight that we've had to cut back on her baked chicken. Spritely Silvie is very adoptable and
looks set to thrive in retirement.
