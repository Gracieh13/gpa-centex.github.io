I am a 2 year old cow dog who is a lot of fun to be around. When I first arrived in my foster home, I wasted no time in starting to snuggle with my foster parents! I'm a quick learner and made the transition to being a pet very easily. I have lots of love to give and am really silly and laid back. I am looking forward to meeting my forever people soon!
