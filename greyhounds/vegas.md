Luck be a lady, this gal ran no races and is lucky enough to go straight into retirement.  For the past few
months, she has lived with her foster family including three children and a cat.  She loves lounging in the yard and
receiving belly rubs from her fosters.  She is house-broken, has been crate-trained and is ready for her forever home.
Will you be the lucky family for Miss Vegas?
