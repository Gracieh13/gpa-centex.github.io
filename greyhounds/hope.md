Hope: The perfect name for a Greyhound making a Greyt recovery! This one-year-old was on track to become a racing
greyhound, but an accident resulted in a broken leg and a premature end to her career. She will need about six weeks to
heal, but she is expected to make a full recovery with no impairment. Once healed, we will be looking for a loving,
forever home for her.
