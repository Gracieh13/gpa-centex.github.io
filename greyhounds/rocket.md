I'm a playful and loving 3 year old male. I love to cuddle with my foster parents and get along really well with my greyhound foster brother. I like to get pets and attention and love my walks. I'm very social and love to get attention anywhere I go, down the street or to the local coffee shop. I can't wait to meet my forever family!
