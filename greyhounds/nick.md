This four-year-old is ready for a happy ending. He wasn't cut out for racing and was adopted fairly early in life.
Unfortunately, the couple that adopted him got a divorce and neither one could keep him. He likes to play a little bit
but is mostly laid back. He'd love to be able to snuggle up on the sofa with you. He's been fine with the children in
his foster home. He's quickly re-adapting to home life and often seems like a saint with his eagerness to please.
