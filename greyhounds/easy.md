This winner suites his name! Easy is the sweetest, most easy going dog you will meet. He loves to hang out with you,
loves to be petted and loved on and is absolutely super on the leash. At four years old, he is out of the puppy "
getting into trouble stage".  Easy to be with, easy to love. A beautiful fawn with lovely expressive eyes. Could he be
your new best friend?
