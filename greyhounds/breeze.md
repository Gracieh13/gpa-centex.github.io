I'm a spunky and curious 6 year old girl who loves to play! I have a very sweet personality and love attention from my humans. I'm always exploring my surroundings and playing with my toys.  I love car rides and getting to go on long walks! I am very curious and a little too curious about small creatures; I'd live best in a home without small animals. I hope to meet my forever family very soon!!
