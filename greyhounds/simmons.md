I am a two year old boy who is just figuring out my new life. I was very shy at first, but I've since learned to come out of my shell little by little. I continue to learn what is expected of me in my foster home. I'm a striking fawn color with black "eyeliner" around my eyes, which everyone comments on. I hope to find my forever home soon!
