Batman, a gorgeous shiny black-coated male, and has white batwings on his chest.  At 17 months and 68 lbs., Batman is
healthy and doing well in foster care.  He crates fine at night (he is a pacer) and when his foster parents are away
from home. He has warmed up to his foster mom and is practicing his manners, Bruce Wayne style.  On his first walk he
saw a cat and showed a lot of interest - so it appears that he is not cat friendly. He is highly food motivated and will
take a treat out of his foster mom's hands, and likes to play by himself with a rope toy. He is increasing his
comfort-level getting in and out of the car.
