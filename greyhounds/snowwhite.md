According to my foster family, I am an all around perfect dog! I'm neat and tidy, loving, adaptable, and beautiful. From the first week, I fit right in with their kids and my greyhound foster brother. I love to be near people and go on walks. I have a pretty shiny black coat and beautiful eyes. I'm hoping to meet my forever family soon!
