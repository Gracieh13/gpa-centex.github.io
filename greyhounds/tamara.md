Tamara is a spry 7 year old girl with a sweet disposition. She loves to cuddle and be held. She
likes to explore new things; to ride in the car and go for long walks. She has a really cute
way of playing that involves spinning in quick circles then tapping her feet like she's playing
a piano. She would be a great dog alone or with other animals in the house.
