I am a very loving and friendly girl, my tail is constantly wagging. I loves to be wherever my human friends are, gaze lovingly at them, and lean against them while they pet me. I get along great with smaller and big dogs. Sometimes hard floors make me nervous, and I walk over it like it's ice. Another funny quirk of mine is that I love to take things from around the house and put them in my crate. I doesn't chew on them, just collect them. I can't wait to meet my forever family soon!
