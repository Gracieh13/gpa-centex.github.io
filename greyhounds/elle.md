Shy yet super sweet, Elle has already figured out relaxation as if she's been retired for years....Such a sweet little
gal, Elle has already learned to lie down and rolls over for belly rubs.  Elle is a dark brindle 18 month old female in
miniature, only 55 lbs. and crates well.  She is cat-possible, and is friendly with other dogs.
