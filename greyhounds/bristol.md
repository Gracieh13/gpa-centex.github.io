I am a sweet, affectionate brindle girl with big brown eyes.  I love getting attention and am
happy to give some back to you.  I enjoy going for walks and discovering new things.  Playing
with these new things called "toys" is quickly becoming one of my favorite activities.  I am
just looking for a forever home with a soft spot to lay on, and hopefully have a few toys to
play with, where I can live out my retirement.
