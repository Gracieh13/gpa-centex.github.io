I’m a petite 6 year old gal with a huge heart. I bonded to my foster family right away, and I love to curl up in my foster dad’s lap. I currently have a foster greyhound brother, who I get along with very well. I’m very sweet and love attention and getting petted. I’m looking for a forever home with a soft bed, treats, and lots of love.
