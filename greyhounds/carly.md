Sophisticated brindle girl seeks a long term relationship with someone who will give me lots of
love. I'm a petite, athletic girl with a soft, shiny coat and dark brown eyes. I love to go on
long walks, play with squeaky toys and eat my foster mom's cooking. I enjoy being with people
who will talk to me and rub my ears.

My perfect evening would be dinner at home, a walk in the neighborhood, and curling-up in a
soft bed next to yours.
