I'm an incredibly sweet, small, black girl integrated just fine into my foster family.  I get along fantastically with other dogs and with children, and am super gentle and sweet.  I've also got a spunky personality when I'm ready to play.  I like squeaky toys and will chase them if you throw them.  I've got a funny personality and smile and click my teeth together in the air when excited.  I'm also incredibly happy just to lounge around and love a big dog bed to lie on.
