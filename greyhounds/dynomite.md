Dynomite is a smart, active, playful young fellow, currently in a foster home with two greyhounds, one male & one alpha
female. He is submissive to the female and is quickly learning his new routine. Dynomite likes to sleep uninterrupted
and doesn't like to be startled awake or hovered over.  He would enjoy a home without cats, and could be happy with
older children and a structured routine.  Additional info forthcoming...
