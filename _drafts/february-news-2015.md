## Adoptions

[Gracie](http://gpa-centex.org/greyhounds/gracie/) was adopted by the Shaftel’s.  This family
waited a long time for just the right dog at just the right time.  Their patience was rewarded
with gregarious, young Gracie.  She is the perfect match for their two active kids, cat and
small dog.  Congratulations!

Belle’s story is a little different, but still has a happy ending.  Belle was
relinquished at the age of twelve due to a change in family circumstances.  She had achy
joints, a bit underweight, and indications of early kidney disease, but the Howell’s saw past
all that.  They fell in love with her dark eyes and knew instantly that this girl still had
life and love in there to share!
