[![Fosters Needed](/img/fosters-needed.png)](/foster/)

If you've ever thought about fostering, now's the time! Tomlinsons has generously donated food
for our foster families, so now there is absolutely no monetary cost to fostering (GPA has
always covered medical treatment and monthly preventative medications). As many of you know, we
appreciate and depend on our foster families to be able to take in greyhounds from the
racetrack. We don't have a "holding" facility, so the number of greyhounds we can find homes
for is absolutely a function of the number of foster families volunteering at any given time.
If you're interested, or would just like to learn more about fostering, please email our foster
coordinator, Catelyn, at [foster@gpa-centex.org](mailto:foster@gpa-centex.org). Thank you so
much for all you do!

has an Instagram following!
